# Aapka Kaam

**Aapka Kaam** is a platform designed to bridge the gap between blue-collar workers and individuals in need of their services. The platform empowers blue-collar workers by giving them a space to showcase their skills, connect with potential clients, and negotiate fair prices for their services. 

### Features:
- **Worker Profiles**: Blue-collar workers can create detailed profiles, showcasing their skills and past work, helping clients assess their capabilities.
- **Job Posting & Application**: Clients can post job requirements, and workers can apply based on their skills, location, and availability.
- **AI-Powered Matching**: AI is used to match workers with relevant job opportunities, making the process smarter and more efficient.
- **Price Negotiation**: The platform includes a feature for clients and workers to negotiate and agree on fair pricing terms.
- **Authentication & Trust**: Workers are verified to ensure authenticity, creating a secure and trustworthy environment for both clients and workers.

### About the Project:
**Aapka Kaam** is focused on empowering the vast number of blue-collar workers in India, who play a critical role in the economy but often face difficulties in accessing reliable job opportunities. The platform aims to provide these workers with better visibility, a more transparent way to negotiate, and a chance to grow their professional network. 

In a country where millions are engaged in blue-collar work, **Aapka Kaam** leverages AI to streamline job matching, enhance skill validation, and optimize pricing, making the entire process simpler and more effective for both workers and clients.

### Vision:
To create an ecosystem that empowers blue-collar workers, connects them to meaningful job opportunities, and ensures fair transactions for both clients and service providers.
